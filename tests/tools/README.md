A list of Gherkin features, which help running some needed work before or after
the full test.

We do have some examples or how to use some of the extra behat features and
added step definitions.

If you want to test the any of the tools features, you will need to use the
 quick_start tools config file, as you can see in the following command.

$ bin/behat --config=behat.quick_start-tools.yml tools/example.feature
